# When bridges fall

## Rest Assured

If funds are deducted from your source wallet, you WILL get them in your destination.

We have auto-claimers always running in the background. As soon as you bridge in or out, they check if the transaction finalized. If it did, the funds are automatically claimed to the destination.

In rare cases, transfer might not be registered. But you can claim your funds yourself using our fallback manual-claim.
