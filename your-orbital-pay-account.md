# Your Orbital Pay Account

Your Orbital Pay account (or Orbital account) is a wallet you use to receive or pay with stablecoins (USDC). You simply log in to create a wallet, and people can use your email or `@orb` id to pay you, or request funds from you.

We use Aptos Network for ultra fast payments (transactions often get finalized in under a second). You are never limited to this chain, as we made it effortless to move in and out. You can bring your funds from any chain (such as Ethereum Mainnet, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) through our bridge for free.

It's equally easy to move funds out of your Orbital Pay account, to other chains. We will provide native cashout options soon.

Businesses often sign users in with their email. Our Orbital SDK makes it easy for them to accept payments in stablecoins with just a button or their custom interface/backends. The payment request shows up on the customer's Orbital Pay account linked with the email, which they can Approve or Deny.
