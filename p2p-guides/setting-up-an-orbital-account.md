# Setting up an Orbital Account

## Step 1 - Log in

Your account is created when you log in to Orbital Pay. We use Google Sign In as a way to derive your wallet. It means you'll get the wallet on any device you can sign in with the same email, be it your laptop or phone.

## Step 2 - Fund your new account

You can fund your new account in many ways. If you have funds on another chain (like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, etc.), you can bring them to your Orbital wallet through [bridges.orbitalpay.xyz](https://bridges.orbitalpay.xyz/) for free.

Alternatively, you can deposit funds to your wallet address (shown on Orbital Pay's website, starting with 0x) from any CEX or from another wallet on the Aptos network. If you came to know of Orbital Pay from a friend, you can even request funds from them!

Don't forget to get yourself an Orbital ID from the Profile section on the left. This helps people to pay you using your @orb name.
