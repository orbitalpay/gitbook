# Manually Create a Checkout Link

On the top right of your merchant console, you'll see a "Create Payment Link" button. Clicking that would open a modal.

You can share this created link with the person you want to accept payment from. You'll see the transaction details in the `Payments` section in your Merchant Console.

If you're not accepting payments at scale, this method would be better for you. However if you have have a backend for your website, or are familiar with other fiat payment gateways, you might find it easier to automate this using our Backend and Frontend SDKs.
