# Create a Checkout

Checkouts are ways in which a user can pay you. A checkout session needs the amount and description (something to tell the user what the payment is about) at the minimum. The Backend SDK also has a feature to request payment from a certain email address.

There are two ways you can create a checkout:

{% content-ref url="manually-create-a-checkout-link.md" %}
[manually-create-a-checkout-link.md](manually-create-a-checkout-link.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="automate-the-checkout-process.md" %}
[automate-the-checkout-process.md](automate-the-checkout-process.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
