# Onboarding as a merchant

We soon plan to open up this process for everyone. For now, this section is for people onboarded as a merchant.

Merchants will see additional tabs on their screen for the console and transaction history.

## Merchant Console

This is the admin dashboard where you can create keys. The keys are intended for backend integration, but are needed to set you up as a merchant. Once you create them, you're good to go.

You can also configure a Callback URL here, where you will be updated regarding state changes to your payments (such as when a user pays, a session times out, or the user declines). This is usually used in conjunction with automated checkouts.
